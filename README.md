# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE
This repository features my solutions to the exercises of the course "Computer Architecture" taken during the 5th semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens

All code written in Assembly, is for the MIPS CPU architecture and has been optimised for maximum efficiency.

Any corrections or suggestions aiming to the improvement of this files will always be welcomed and aprreciated!

//Update: This repository also includes a .pdf file I created, featuring some useful Assembly information for MIPS Architecture, deisgned for fellow students!
